Compared forecasting of bitcoin prices with both ARIMA and LSTM 


To my suprise, ARIMA was more accurate, LSTM had some problem predicting prices after march 2020 (I believe this might be 
due to the corona virus, and the spike in prices)


*if I come back to this, I would like to do more experimenting with LSTM epoch sizes, batch sizes, and changing the number 
of predictors

*matplotlib, ARIMA, keras, Long Short Term Memory
